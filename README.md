# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It generates a random password based on user-defined criteria such as length and character types.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap (for styling)

## Files Included
- `index.html`: Contains the structure and content of the web page.
- `style.css`: Contains the styles for the web page elements.
- `generator.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for generating random passwords.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Adjust the password length using the range slider.
3. Check/uncheck the checkboxes to include/exclude character types (capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters).
4. Click the "Generate Password" button to generate a random password based on the selected criteria.
5. The generated password will be displayed in the "Generated Password" input field.

## Additional Notes
- The password generation logic is implemented in `generator.js`.
- The styling is done using Bootstrap and custom CSS (`style.css`).
- The web page is responsive and adjusts well to different screen sizes.
